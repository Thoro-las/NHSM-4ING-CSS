#chap("Introduction")[
  Optimization in general is the process of finding minimum or maximum of numerical functions, i.e. functions $f: E -> RR$ where $E$ is a set. In the case of combinatorial optimization, we consider the set to be discrete, that is, we take the sets to be finite or countable.

The notations and the terminology all comes from the continuous optimization course, here is a simple terminology remainder
