#chap("Introduction")[
  Optimization in general is the process of finding minimum or maximum of numerical functions, i.e. functions $f: E -> RR$ where $E$ is a set. In the case of combinatorial optimization, we consider the set to be discrete, that is, we take the sets to be finite or countable.

#nte[
  Discrete sets are considered in general to be either spaces with the order topology being a discrete topology or having an induced topology that is a discrete topology. I am not sure why we took the above definition for this course.
]

The notations and the terminology all comes from the continuous optimization course, here is a simple terminology remainder
