  Let $a, b, m in ZZ$ with $m > 0$, we say that $a$ is congruent to $b$ modulo $m$ and we write $a equiv b mod m$ if $m divides a - b$ which gives an equivalence relation. The class of $a$ in the congruence relation by $m$ is called the congruence class of $a$ modulo $m$, which is $overline(a) = a + m ZZ$.

+ Let $K = ZZ\/5ZZ$, factor $(x^2 + 4)(x^2 + 3)$ into irreducible factors over $K$, $-3=2 mod 5$ is not a quadratic residue since $2^((5-1)/2) = 4 = -1 mod 5$ thus $x^2 + 3$ is irreducible given it has no roots. While $-4=1$ is a quadratic residue with roots $-1$ and $1$ so $(x^2 + 4)(x^2 + 3) = (x^2 - 1)(x^2 + 3) = (x - 1)(x + 1)(x^2 + 3)$.

  x - 2 = a(x+1)(x^2 + 3) + b(x+4)(x^2 + 3) + (c x + d)(x + 4)(x + 1)
$ we set the following values for $x$
  - $x = -1$: $-3 = b(-1 + 4)(1 + 3) = 12 b = 2 b => b = 3*(-3) = -9 = 1$.
  - $x = +1$: $-1 = a(1 + 1)(1 + 3) = 8 a = 3 a => a = 2*(-1) = -2 = 3$.

+ $a^16 = 1 mod 17$ by Fermat little theorem, then $a^(560) = a^(16 dot.c 35) = 1 mod 17$ thus, $a^(561) = a mod 17 => 17 | a^561 - a$.
+ Same here, $a^10 = 1 mod 11$ by Fermat little theorem, then $a^(560) = a^(10 dot.c 56) = 1 mod 11$ thus, $a^(561) = a mod 11 => 11 | a^561 - a$.
+ Given that all the divisors of $561$ divide $a^561 - a$ then it is divisible by their product so $561 | a^561 - a => a^561 equiv a mod 561$.

This diagram present the general structure of any communication system. The communication process begins with an information source. We start by thinking what a message could be. In general, we can consider a message to be constructed by a set of symbols $cal(X) = {x_1, dots, x_n}$ and given a context, has a distribution of which of those symbols are sent. Thus, we consider a message consecutive realizations of a random variable $X$ defined in $cal(X)$.

Now the goal is to quantify information, thus given $X tilde P_X (x)$, we define the amount of information for some symbol $x$ to be $I(x) = - log_2 (P_X (x))$ (justifications for these definitions will be in the next chapter). Then, we can define an average amount of information from a source $X$, which is called the entropy $H(X) = EE[I(X)]$. Such a quantity is important given Shannon's first theorem, which gives a lower bound for any data compression.

After being able to measure the amount of information, we can measure efficiency of some encodings both for source and channel by how much redundancy is added to how much is actually needed.

#section[The Communication System Model]
Shannon's groundbreaking contribution was a formal model that describes communication between two entities, whether machine or humans. This model highlights the essential components:
- Source: the originator of the information.
- Channel: The medium through which information is transmitted.
- Recipient: The receiver of the information.

#subsection[Source \& Message]
The sources generate a message composed of symbols from a specific alphabet.
- Discrete data: text, numbers, symbols.
- Digitized analog data: image, voice, video converted to digital form.

#subsection[Transmitter Processing]
The transmitter performs three crucial operations.
+ Source Coding: data compression to minimize message size.
+ Channel Coding: adding redundancy for error correction.
+ Modulation: converting digital messages to physical signal.

#subsection[Receiver Processing]
The receiver performs these receiver operations.
+ Demodulation: converting physical signal into a digital message.
+ Channel Decoding: error detection and correction.
+ Source Decoding: reconstruction of the original message.

#def(name: "Symbol/Message", ovcount: false)[
  Let $cal(X)={x_1, dots, x_m}$ be a finite set of alphabets. An element of $cal(X)$ is called a symbol, and elements of $cal(X)^+$ are called a message with alphabet $cal(X)$.
]

#ooc[
  To model information that was given from a message, we consider the fact that a message contains more information the more unpredictable it is. For example, consider a sender that keeps sending the message "Hello!" over and over again, at each iteration, it becomes predictable what the next message would be, thus there is no more information that is passed. Uncertainty is a property of a random process, thus a good way to model a message is to consider it as a random variable $X$ that has values in $cal(X)$. From the previous example too, we can think that the information in a message is related to how uncertain it is, that is, how less probable it would be sent. Also, notice that the information from independent events should be additive, that is, if even $p$ and $q$ happen that are independent, then the amount of information gained from the even $p q$ happening is the sum of information gained from both the events $p$ and $q$.

  #ntt[
    For the sake of simplifying notation, we will denote $P(X = x)$ as $P(x)$, same for other random variables, like $P(Y = y)$ as $P(y)$. Same for all the remaining notations like $P(y|x)$ which is $P(Y = y|X = x)$.
  ]
]

To define a measure for information $I: cal(X) -> RR$, we start by considering some random variable $X$ that represents a source of symbols $cal(X)$. As discussed before, the information will be a function of probability, thus we take $I(x) = phi(P(x))$ from our previous discussion it would satisfy the following postulates:

- Postulate 1: Information depends only on probability $I(A) = phi(P(A))$.
- Postulate 2: Certain events provide no information $phi(1) = 0$.
- Postulate 3: Information decreases with increasing probability, $phi$ is decreasing.
- Postulate 4: Impossible events provide infinite information $P(0) = infinity$.
- Postulate 5: Information from independent events $phi(p q) = phi(p) + phi(q)$.

Also, clearly $phi$ would be continuous since a tiny difference in probability would result in a tiny difference in the amount of information that it would result in.

#ooc[
  We will briefly prove that $phi equiv - log_b$ for any base $b$. By induction we have that $phi(a^n) = n f(a)$ and since $phi(a) = phi(a^(q\/q)) = q phi(a^q)$ then necessarily $phi(a^(p\/q)) = (p\/q) phi(a)$. By continuity, we have $forall x in RR, phi(a^x) = x phi(a)$. Now take $t = log_a x$, then $phi(x) = phi(a^t) = t phi(a) = phi(a) log_a x$, thus $phi(x) = phi(a) log_a (x)$, by taking $x -> 0$, we have that $phi(a) log_a (x) -> +infinity$ so $phi(a) < 0$. Therefore, $phi equiv - log_b$ for some $b$.
]

#def(name: "Measure Of Information", ovcount: false)[
  Let $X$ be a random variable that represents the probability that a message $x$ is sent as $P(X = x) = P(x)$, we define the measure of information of the message $x$ as $
    I(x) = - log_2 P(x)
  $
]

#ooc[
  $log_2$ is taken for the usual reason that information is represented in binary, and that if it is represented in any other base, it would have just a linear factor added. In practice, transmission lines tend to cause irregularities in the signal, that is, it alters the contents of the message with some noise. Thus, in transmission lines we are interested in the distribution of the message $y$ that are received, given some sent message $x$, which will be measured by $P(y|x)$.
]

#section[Entropy]
#ooc[
  After we defined a measure of information, which we discussed to be a measure of uncertainty, we need a way to quantify the average amount of uncertainty for all the values of $X$. Thus, we define the entropy as follows.
]

#def(name: "Entropy", ovcount: false)[
  Let $X$ be a random variable with values in $cal(X)$, we define the entropy $H(X)$ as the average amount of information, that is $
    H(X) = EE[I(X)] = - sum_(x in X) P(x) dot.c log_2 P(x)
  $
]


Notice that the information of some message $x$ depends only on its unpredictability, that is, its probability of occurrence $P(x)$ not its value.

#pro[
  Let $X, Y$ with symbols in $cal(X), cal(Y)$ be two i.i.d sources.
  + Non-negativity: $H(X) >= 0$.
  + Maximum Entropy: $H(X) <= log_2 card cal(X)$.
  + Independent Additivity: $X perp Y$ $=>$ $H(X Y) = H(X) + H(Y)$.
]

#ooc[
  #prf[
    + $forall x in cal(X), I(x) >= 0$, then $H(X) = EE[I(X)] >= 0$
    + Here, we optimize on the distribution of $X$, $max_(P) H(X) = - min_P sum_(x in X) P(x) dot.c log_2 P(x),$ hence for $I$ a finite set $min_({y_i in [0, 1]}_(i in I)) sum_(i in I) y_i log_2 (y_i)$ with $sum_(i in I) y_i = 1$. Notice that all the terms have the same sign so $min sum_(i in I) dots = sum_(i in I) min dots$. $y_i$ all having the same range would mean that we just need to find $c$ such that $y_i = c$ and satisfies the second inequality, which is clearly $c = 1/(card I)$. 

    So $X$ would be a uniform distribution over $cal(X)$, $H_u (X) = EE[I(X)] = - sum_(x in X) 1\/(card cal(X)) log_2 (1\/(card cal(X))) = log_2 card cal(X) >= H(X)$.
    + Let $X, Y$ be two independent variables, then $H(X Y) = EE[I(X Y)] = EE[I(X) + I(Y)] = EE[I(X)] + EE[I(Y)] = H(X) + H(Y)$.

  DNA sequences provide an excellent example of entropy application. Let's consider:
  - Primate DNA: $P(A) = P(G) = P(C) = P(T) = 1\/4$. $H(X) = 2$
  - Bacterial DNA: $P(G) = P(C) = 0.38$, $P(A) = P(T) = 0.12$. $H(X) = 1.795$.
  The entropy of bacterial DNA indicates more predictable sequences compared to the primate DNA.

    + trivial by $P(x, y) = P(X = x, Y = y) = P(Y = y, X = x) = P(y, x)$.
    + $forall x in X, forall y in Y, 0 <= P(x, y) <= 1 => log_2 P(x, y) <= 0$ so we have $P(x, y) log_2 P(x, y) <= 0$. Hence, $
      H(X, Y) = - sum_(x in X) sum_(y in Y) P(x, y) log_2 P(x, y) >= 0
    $
    + We have $H(X, Y) - H(X) - H(Y) = sum_(x in X) P(x) log_2 P(x) + sum_(y in Y) P(y) log_2 P(y) - sum_((x, y) in X times Y) P(x, y) log_2 P(x, y)$, by using the fact that $P(x) = sum_(y in Y) P(x, y)$, we can transform all the sums to be indexed with $X times Y$ as follows: $
      sum_(x in X) P(x) log_2 P(x) &= sum_((x, y) in X times Y) P(x, y) log_2 P(x) \
      sum_(y in Y) P(x) log_2 P(y) &= sum_((x, y) in X times Y) P(x, y) log_2 P(y)
    $ Thus we obtain the writing $
      H(X, Y) - H(X) - H(Y) = sum_((x,y) in X times Y) P(x, y) log_2 ((P(x) P(y))/(P(x, y)))
    $ We have that $forall t >= 0, log_2 (t) <= t - 1$ thus $
      H(X, Y) - H(X) - H(Y) &= sum_((x, y) in X times Y) P(x, y) log_2 ((P(x) P(y))/(P(x, y))) \
      & <= sum_((x, y) in X times Y) P(x, y) ((P(x) P(y))/(P(x,y)) - 1)\
      & <= sum_((x, y) in X times Y) P(x) P(y) - P(x, y) \
      & <= sum_((x, y) in X times Y) P(x) P(y) - sum_((x, y) in X times Y) P(x, y) \
      & <= 1 - 1 = 0
    $ Therefore $
      H(X, Y) <= H(X) + H(Y)
    $
    + Without loss of generality, we prove that $H(X, Y) >= H(X)$, we have from before that $P(x) = sum_(y in Y) P(x,y)$ and since $forall (x, y) in X times Y, P(x, y) >= 0$ then $forall (x, y) in X times Y, P(x, y) <= P(x)$.
    $
      H(X, Y) &= - sum_((x, y) in X times Y) P(x, y) log_2 P(x, y) \
      &>= - sum_((x, y) in X times Y) P(x) log_2 P(x) = H(X)
    $ and same to prove that $H(X, Y) >= H(Y)$ and hence we obtain the inequality $H(X, Y) >= max(H(X), H(Y))$.
