#chapter[Group Actions][]

#def(name: "Group Actions")[
  Let $G$ be a group and $X != emptyset$, we say that $G$ acts (operates) on $X$ if there is a homomorphism $phi: G -> cal(S)(X)$ the group of permutations of $x$.
]

To avoid complicated notation, we denote $phi(g)(x) = phi_g (x)$ as $g dot.c x$. Notice in this case $e dot.c x = phi(e)(x) = Id(x) = x$ and $(g_1 g_2) dot.c x = phi(g_1 g_2) (x) = phi(g_1) compose phi(g_2) (x) = g_1 dot.c (g_2 dot.c x)$.

#def(name: "Group Actions")[
  Let $G$ be a group and $X != emptyset$ if there is a map $G times X -> X, (g, x) |-> g dot.c x$ where it satisfies the following two identities for any $x in X$, $g_1, g_2 in G$, $e dot.c x = x$ and $g_1 g_2 dot.c x = g_1 dot.c (g_2 dot.c x)$ then we say that $G$ acts on $X$.
]

The two previous definitions are equivalent.

#def(name: "Orbit/Stabilizer")[
  Let $G$ be a group acting on $X$ ($X$ is a $G$-set) and let $x in X$, we define the following
  + The orbit of $x$ as $O_x = { g dot.c x | g in G }$.
  + The stabilizer of $x$ as $S_x = { g in G | g dot.c x = x }$.
]

#pro[
  $S_x$ is a subgroup of $G$.
]

#prf[
  By definition $2$, we have $e dot.c x = x$ thus $e in S_x$. Let $g_1, g_2 in S_x$ then $g_1 dot.c x = x$ and $g_2 dot.c x = x$, so $g_1 g_2 dot.c x = g_1 (g_2 dot.c x) = g_1 x = x$ so $g_1 g_2 in S_x$. Also, $g_1 dot.c x = x => x = e dot.c x = g_1^(-1) (g_1 dot.c x) = g_1^(-1) dot.c x$ thus $g_1^(-1) in S_x$.
]

#pro[
  The relation defined on $X$ by $x cal(R) x' <=> x' in O_x$ is an equivalence relation and the class of $x$ is $O_x$.
]

#prf[
  Trivial.
]

#def(name: "")[
  + If $O_x = X$ for some $x in X$, then we say that $G$ acts transitively on $X$.
  + If $O_x = {x}$, then $x$ is said to be stable or fixed, in this case $S_x = G$.
]

#pro[
  Let $X$ be a $G$-set and let $x, y$ in the same orbit, then $S_x$ and $S_y$ are conjugates.
]

#prf[
  Let $y in O_x$, then $y = g x$ for some $g in G$. Let $h in S_x$, then $h x = x$, $(g h g^(-1)) (y) = g h x = g x = y$ therefore $g S_x g^(-1) subset S_y$ in a similar way we get $g^(-1) S_y g subset S_x$ by multiplying both sides by $g$ and $g^(-1)$ we get $S_y subset g S_x g^(-1)$ which gives that $S_y = g S_x g^(-1)$.
]

#pro[
  Let $X$ be a $G$-set, then there is a bijection between the set of left cosets of $S_x$ in $G$ and $O_x$.
]

#prf[
  Let $cal(L)$ be the set of left cosets. Consider the function $phi: cal(L) -> O_x, g S_x |-> g x$. $phi$ is well defined and injective since $g S_x = h S_x <=> h^(-1) g in S_x <=> h^(-1) g x = x <=> g x = h x <=> phi(g S_x) = phi(h S_x)$ and it is surjective by definition.
]

#cor[
  Let $G$ finite and let $X$ be a $G$-set then $card G = card O_x dot.c card S_x$.
]

#prf[
  By Lagrange theorem, we have that $card G = card S_x [G:S_x]$ and by the previous proposition we have $card G = card S_x [G:S_x] = card S_x card O_x$.
]

#cor(name: "Class Equation")[
  Let $G$ be finite and let $O_x_1, O_x_2, dots, O_x_n$ be the distinct orbits of $G$-set $X$ then $X$ is finite and $card X = sum_(i=1)^n card O_x_i$.
]

#def(name: "p-Group")[
  Let $G$ be a group of order $p^n$ where $p$ is a prime and $n in NN$, $G$ is said to be a $p$-group.
]

A subgroup of a $p$-group is also a $p$-group by Lagrange's theorem.


#cor(name: "Burnside")[
  The center of a $p$-group is a $p$-group.
]

#prf[
  Let $G$ be a $p$-group, $cal(Z)(G)$ the center of $G$ and consider the action on $G$ defined by $G times G -> G, (g, x) |-> g x g^(-1)$. Let $O_x_1, dots, O_x_k$ be the distinct orbits for this action. Notice that $forall x in X, O_x = {x} <=> forall g in G, g x g^(-1) = x <=> forall g in G, g x = x g <=> x in cal(Z)(G)$. Suppose that $card G = p^n$, then is either $card O_x_i = 1$ or $card O_x_i = p^(n_i)$ and suppose that $cal(Z)(G) = {x_1, dots, x_s}$. Thus by the class equation $
    card G = card X &= sum_(i=1)^s card O_x_i + sum_(i=s+1)^n card O_x_i\
    p^n &= s + (p^(n_(s+1)) + dots.c + p^(n_k)) \
    s &= p^n - (p^(n_(s+1)) + dots.c + p^(n_k))
  $
  $s >= 1$ given that $e in cal(Z)(G)$ and since $p$ divides the RHS then it divides $s$ so the center is a $p$-group.
]

#cor(name: "Cauchy")[
  Let $G$ be a finite group and let $p$ a prime number that divides $card G$, then there is an element in $G$ of order $p$.
]

#prf[
  We have already proven this result for the case where $G$ is abelian. Suppose that $G$ is non-abelian. Consider $card G = n$. For $n = 1$, the result is trivial. Suppose that the result is true for all non-abelian groups of order less than $n$. If there is a subgroup $H$ of $G$ whose order is divisible by $p$, we get the result from the induction hypothesis. So suppose that $card H equiv.not 0 mod p$ for all subgroups $H$ of $G$ with $H != G$. Consider the conjugation action $g dot.c x = g x g^(-1)$. We have that $O_x = {»} <=> x in cal(Z)(G)$. Let $O_x_1, dots, O_x_r$ be the orbits of the action where $x_1, dots, x_s$ are in $cal(Z)(G)$. Then by class equation we have $card G = s + sum_(i=s+1)^r O_x_i$, on the other hand $card O_x_i = card G \/ card S_x_i$, we have that $card O_x_i > 1$ for $x_i in.not cal(Z)(G)$, $p$ does not divide $card S_x_i$ and it divides $card G$ thus it divides $card O_x_i$, it follows that $p$ divides $s$ and thus $p | card cal(Z)(G)$ which is a contradiction.
]

#thm(name: "First Sylow Theorem")[
  Let $G$ be a finite group of order $p^n m$ with $n, m in NN$, $p$ prime and $p divides.not m$, then $forall k in [|1, n|]$ there is a subgroup of order $p^k$.
]

#prf[
  We use induction on $k$.
  - For $k = 1$, the result is true by Cauchy.
  - Suppose that the result is true for all $1 <= k <= n - 1$. Let $H$ be a subgroup of $G$ with order $p^k$, we have that $(N(H):H) equiv (G:H) mod p$ since $(G:H) = p^(n - k) m$ and so $p|(G:H) => p|(N(H):H)$. Consider $pi: N(H) -> N(H) \/ H$, the canonical surjection, $Ker pi = H$, $p|card (N(H)\/H)$ , by Cauchy's theorem, there exists a subgroup $K'$ of $N(H)\/H$ with order $p$. Then $pi^(-1)(K')$ is a subgroup $K$ of $N(H)$ containing $H$. Consider $pi|_K: K -> K'$, $Ker pi|_K = H$, the first isomorphism gives that $K\/H iso K'$ and thus $card K' = card H card K = p^k p = p^(k+1)$ and thus $K$ is a subgroup of $G$ such that $p^(k+1)$.
]

#def(name: "")[
  Let $G$ be a finite group with order $p^n m$, $n, m in NN$, $p$ prime and $p divides.not m$, then a subgroup of $G$ with order $p^n$ is called a Sylow $p$-subgroup of $G$.
]

Notice that the conjugate of a Sylow $p$-subgroup of $G$, is also a Sylow $p$-subgroup.

#thm(name: "Second Sylow Theorem")[
  All Sylow $p$-subgroups are conjugates, that is, if $P_1$ and $P_2$ have order $p^n$, then $exists g in G, P_2 = g P_1 g^(-1)$.
]

#prf[
  Consider the action $P_2 times cal(L)_(P_1) -> cal(L)_(P_1), y dot.c g P_1 = (y g) P_1$. Suppose that $O_(g P_1) = {g P_1}$ that is $forall y in P_2, y dot.c g P_1 = g P_1 => g^(-1) y g in P_1 => g^(-1) P_1 g subset P_2$ and since $card P_2 = card g^(-1) P_2 g = card P_1 $ thus $g^(-1) P_1 g = P_2$. Hence, if there is a fixed point for this action then $P_2$ and $P_1$ are conjugates. On the other hand, the class equation gives $
    m = (m p^n) / (p^n) = (card G) / (card P_1) = card cal(L)_(P_1) = sum_(i = 1)^s card O_(g_i P_1) + sum_(i=b+1)^r card O_(g_i P_1)
  $
  where the first $s$ orbits are of order $1$ and the remaining are of order $>1$, we have $
    card O_(g_i P_1) = (card P_2)/(card S(g_i P_1)) => forall i in [|s+1, dots, r|], p|card O_(g_i P_1)
  $ Hence $p|card_(i=s+1)^r card O_(g_i P_1)$ and $p$ does not divide $m$ thus $p$ does not divide $sum_(i=1)^s card O_(g_i P_1)$ thus $sum_(i=1)^s card O_(g_i p) != 0$.
]

#ntt[
  We denote the number of Sylow $p$-subgroups of a group $G$ as $n_p$.
]

#cor[
  If $G$ is abelian finite and $p | card G$ prime then $n_p = 1$.
]

#thm(name: "Third Sylow's Theorem")[
  Let $G$ be a finite group with order $p^n m$, $n, m in NN, p$ prime and $p divides.not m$, $n_p equiv 1 mod p$ and $n_p$ divides $m$.
]

#prf[
  We will prove that $n_p$ divides $card G$. We have that $n_p equiv 1 mod p$. Let $phi$ set of Sylow $p$-subgroups $
    G times phi &-> phi\
    (g, P) &|-> g P g^(-1)
  $ Let $P in phi$ then $O_p = phi$ by theorem $2$, then the class equation gives $
    n_p = card phi = card O_p = (G:S_P)
  $ and $card O_p$ divides $card G$ then $n_p$ divides $card G$.

#chapter[Free Abelian Groups][]

For an abelian group $G$, the identity $e = 0$, operation $+$, $forall n in NN^*$ define $
  0 x = 0 \
  n x = underbrace(x + dots.c + x, n)\ 
  (-n) x = underbrace(-x + dots.c + -x, n)
$

If $X subset G$, $X$ generates $G$ if $forall g in G, exists {x_i}_(i=1)^n subset X, exists {k_i}_(i=1)^n subset ZZ, g = k_1 x_1 + dots.c + k_n x_n$.

#pro[
  Let $X$ be a subset of a non-zero abelian group $G$. Then the following are equivalent:
  + $forall g in G\\{0}$, $g$ is uniquely written as a linear combination $g=k_1 x_1 + dots.c k_n x_n$ with non-null coefficients $k_i in ZZ^*$ and $x_i in X$.
  + $X$ generates $G$ and $forall n in NN^*, forall x_1, dots, x_n in X, forall k_1, dots.c, k_n in ZZ, k_1 x_1 + dots.c k_n x_n = 0 => k_1 = dots.c = k_n = 0$.
]

#prf[
  $1 => 2.$ since $0 = 0 x$ we have that $X$ generates $G$. If $X = {0} => G = {0}$ which is not the case thus $X != {0}$. Suppose now $k_1 x_1 + dots.c + k_n x_n = 0$, we have then $x_1 = 1 x_1 + 0 = 1 x_1 + k_1 x_1 + dots.c + k_n x_n = (1 + k_1) x_1 + k_1 x_1 + dots.c + k_n x_n$, from the unicity of writing we have that necessarily $k_1 + 1 = 1$ and $forall i in [|2, n|], k_i = 0$ thus $forall i in [|1,n|], k_i = 0$. $2 => 1.$ Suppose that for some $g in G\\{0}$, we have that $g = k_1 x_1 + dots.c + k_n x_n = l_1 y_1 + dots.c + l_m y_m$, by adding terms with zero coefficients we get that $g = k_1 x_1 + dots.c + k_n x_n + k_(n+1) x_(n+1) + dots.c + k_s x_s = m_1 x_1 + dots.c + l_n x_n + l_(n+1) x_(n+1) + dots.c + l_s x_s$, hence $0 = g - g = (x_1 l_1$

#def(name: "Free Abelian Group")[
  An abelian group having the property $1$ or $2$ is said to be free and $X$ is called a basis of $G$.

#exm[
  + $ZZ$ is free with basis ${1}$.
  + $ZZ^n$ is free with basis ${e_i = (0, dots, 0, 1, 0, dots, 0)}_(i=1)^n$
  + $ZZ_n$ is not free, we have that $forall a in ZZ_n, n a = 0$.
  + All finite groups are not free, since by Lagrange, if $G$ is a finite group with order $n$ then $forall g in G, n g = e$.
