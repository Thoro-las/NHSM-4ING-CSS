#def(name: "Signal/Noise")[
  A signal is a physical representation of information that is sent from source to destination. Noise is any interference happening in the process of reading or interpreting the signal.
]

#def(name: "Signal-Noise Ratio")[
  Let $P_s$ and $P_n$ represent the power of the signals of signal and noise respectively, then the signal-noise ratio is defined as $xi = P_s\/P_n$.
]

This ratio represents the noise affects the signal, as in the higher $xi$ is, the more powerful is the signal to the noise. In general, we indicate it with a logarithmic measure $xi_(d B) = 10 log_10 xi$.

#section[Fourier Transform]

#def(name: "Fourier Transform")[
  Let $x: RR -> RR$ a function representing a signal dependent of time $t$. The Fourier transform of the function $x$ is a function of frequency $f$, $X(f)$ such that $
    cal(F)(x)(f) = X(f) = integral_(-infinity)^infinity x(t) e^(- i 2pi f t) dif t
  $
  where $i$ is the imaginary unit.
]

The Fourier transform is used to transform a function from the time domain to frequency/phase domain. This operation is not one way only, in many cases, we can go back to the time domain just from the frequency/phase domain, which is done by the Inverse Fourier Transform.

#def(name: "Inverse Fourier Transform")[
  Let $X: RR -> RR$ a function representing the strength of frequencies of a signal with parameter $f$. The inverse Fourier transform of the function $X$ is a function of time $x(t)$ such that $
    cal(F)^(-1)(X)(t) = x(t) = integral_(-infinity)^infinity X(f) e^(i 2 pi f t) dif f
  $
]

We prove that the inverse Fourier transform is indeed an inverse function.

#thm(name: "Fourier Inversion")[

An example here will be given with using finite frequencies to explain what does this transform do.

#exm[
  Consider the following function 

  #table(
    columns: (2fr, 1fr),
    align: center + horizon,
    stroke: 0mm,
    lq.diagram(
      xlim: (-3.2, 3.2),
      ylim: (-0.7, 1.2),
      width: 100%,
      lq.plot((-3, -1, -1, 1, 1, 3), (0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0))
    ),
    $
      x(t) = cases(
        1 &"if" |t| < 1,
        0 &"otherwise"
      )
    $
  )

  By calculating the Fourier transform we get $
    X(f) = integral_(-infinity)^infinity x(t) e^(-i 2 pi f t) dif t = integral_(-1)^1 e^(-i 2 pi f t) dif t
  $

  For $f = 0$ we get $2$, thus we consider $f != 0$ $
    X(f) &= integral_(-1)^1 e^(-i 2 pi f t) dif t = [e^(-i 2 pi f t) / (- i 2 pi f)]_(t=-1)^(t=1) = (e^(- (2 pi f) i) - e^((2 pi f) i))/(- 2 i pi f) = sin(2 pi f)/(pi f)
  $

  Now we plot this function for some values of $f$

  #lq.diagram(
    xlim: (-3.2, 3.2),
    ylim: (-1.2, 2.6),
    width: 100%,
    lq.plot(lq.linspace(-20, 20, num: 200), f => calc.sin(2*calc.pi*f) / (calc.pi * f), smooth: true, mark: none)
  )

  What the previous graph represents in this case is the strength of each frequency in the signal. For example, the frequency $0$ is the strongest frequency in the function $x(t)$ which is clearly true since most of the function is constant, the remaining frequencies come from the rising-edge and falling-edge at $-1$ and $1$.
]

A useful operator in the usage of Fourier transforms is the convolution.

#def(name: "Convolution")[
  Let $x, y: RR -> RR$ two integrable functions. We define the convolution of $x$ and $y$ as $x convolve y$ as follows $
    x convolve y : RR &-> RR\
      t &|-> integral_(-infinity)^infinity x(s) y(t - s) dif s
  $
]

And an important result we get in this case is the convolution theorem stating that $cal(F)(x convolve y) = cal(F)(x) dot.c cal(F)(y)$. More useful results will be explained later.

#section[Operations On Signals]
Given a signal $x(t)$ we define the following quantities on an interval $[-T/2, T/2]$:
+ Average value: $
  overline(x)(T) = 1/T integral_(-T\/2)^(T\/2) x(t) dif t
$
+ Quadratic value (Normalized energy): $
  W_x (T) = integral_(-T\/2)^(T\/2) x^2 (t) dif t
$
+ Average quadratic value (Normalized power): $
  P_x (T) = 1/T integral_(-T\/2)^(T\/2) x^2(t) dif t
$
