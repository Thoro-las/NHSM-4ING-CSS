#chapter[Introduction To Random Number Generators][
  Random number generation is an important part of many modern applications both in science and technology. It provides a source for randomness for stochastic simulations, cryptography, security, also adds realism for games by adding predictability. Yet, computers are known to be deterministic machines, that is, there is no intrinsic randomness is inside of those machines. So the goal is to study algorithms that give pseudo-random sequences that can be used in each of their appropriate application.

The existence of randomness is a philosophical debate, whether the world is deterministic or not is a question yet to be answered, especially with the developments of quantum mechanics. But, for all intents and purposes, we usually refer by random events to events that are hard to predict. Thus, we define a sequence to be pseudo-random if it is deterministically generated but its values are predictable without knowing all the inputs and the workflow of the algorithm.

Pseudo-random number generation relies on the following criteria to improve its practicality:
- Computationally impredictive: given a sequence from the pseudo-random number generator, it is hard to determine the algorithm or the inputs that were used to create it, and predict the upcoming values.
- Uniformly distributed: the generated numbers should be uniformly distributed.
- Absence of correlation: there should be no correlation between observations at a certain moment and the next values.
- Sufficient period length: given that the algorithm is deterministic and the amount of representeable numbers is finite, then the algorithm will at some point turn back to its initial values, but such a period should be extremely large.

Differently from random number generation in simulations or other areas, RNG in cryptography, the security of a system is highly dependent on many parts, one of them being the unpredictability of the keys for encryption.

#section[Types Of Random Number Generators]
+ TRNG (True Random Number Generator): such random number generators use physical phenomena to generate values, and thus, it is practically impossible to have the exact same circumstances for the generation which makes it impredictible and irreproducible and is not forced to have any period.
+ PRNG (Pseudo Random Number Generator): uses deterministic algorithms with a seed to generate a pseudo-random sequence of numbers, which is reproducible if given the same seed but generally with a huge period.
+ QRNG (Quasi Random Number Generator): is also a deterministic sequence, but its goal is to have a low discrepancy, that is, the sequences are generated to be mainly equidistributed on the space, and are not as impredictible in general.

#chapter[Pseudo-Random Number Generation][]

#def(name: "PRNG")[
  A PRNG is a deterministic algorithm which generates a sequence of numbers that seem random, which uses an initial value called the seed and generates the next terms based on previous ones.
]

Generally, we try to use external sources to find seeds like the temperature of a CPU, the number of processes running or the current time of execution, and thus increases its unpredictability. 

Characteristics of such generators are:
- From the definition, given the same seed, we can get the same sequence.
- Generate sequences quite efficiently for high performance applications.
- It would necessarily have a finite period.

#section[Congruence Generators]
Define the set $ZZ^(n star) = union_(n in NN) ZZ^n$ the set of all possible finite sequences from $ZZ$, and $Theta$ a set of all possible parameters $theta$.

#def(name: "Congruence Generator")[
  Let $f: ZZ^(n star) times Theta -> ZZ$, $theta in Theta$, $m in ZZ$, and ${X_n}$ a sequence with $X_0$ being the seed, and is defined as $
    X_n = f((X_i)_(i=1)^(n-1); theta) mod m
  $
]
Here the generator depends on two prior parameters $(theta, m)$, also a seed to generate the same sequence. We start with the most basic congruence generator.

#def(name: "Simple Linear Congruence Generator")[
  We consider in this case $Theta = ZZ^2$, $f((X_i)_(i=1)^n; (a, b)) = a X_(n-1) + b$, and so we get $
    X_n = a X_(n-1) + b mod m
  $
]

#pro[
  A SLCG sequence is of a period at most $m$.
]

#ooc[
  #prf[
    Let $(X_n)_(n in NN)$ be a sequence generated by a simple linear congruence generator, there are at most $m$ different values for each term $X_n$ so by pigeon-hole principle, if we take the first $m + 1$ terms then there are $2$ numbers that are equal. Notice also that if $X_i = X_j$ for some $i != j$, then necessarily $X_(i+1) = X_(j+1)$ and thus the period is exactly the smallest number that repeats. And from our previous step, it is clear that in the best case the smallest repeating number would be the $m^"th"$ term.
  ]

  So, our goal is to find some conditions to get the maximum period, that is, period $m$, which is given in the following theorem.
]

#thm(name: "Hull-Dubell")[
  Let $(X_n)_(n in NN)$ a sequence generated by an SLCG $X_n = a X_(n-1) + b mod m$, $(X_n)$ has a period $m$ if and only if the following conditions are true:
  - $b$ and $m$ are coprime.
  - $a-1$ is divisible by all prime factors of $a-1$.
  - if $4$ divides $m$, then $4$ divides $a-1$.
]

#ooc[
  #lem[
    Let $m in ZZ$ and its prime decomposition $m = product_(i = 1)^r p_i^(k_i)$ and consider $T(x) equiv a x + b mod m$ then $T$ has period $m$ if and only if for all $i in [|1, r|]$, $T_i (x) equiv a x + b mod p_i^(k_i)$ has period $p_i^(k_i)$.
  ]

  #prf[
    By the Chinese Remainder Theorem, we have $ZZ\/m ZZ iso product_(i=1)^r ZZ\/p_i^(k_i) ZZ$, and thus we obtain by this correspondence $T |-> (T_1, dots, T_r)$ such that $T_i (x) equiv a x + b mod p_i^(k_i)$
