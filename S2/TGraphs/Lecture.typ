#def(name: "Undirected Graph", ovcount: false)[
  An undirected graph $G$ is an ordered pair $G=(V, E)$ where $V$ is a finite set called the vertex set (vertices) and $E subset {{u, v} | u, v in V}$ called the set of edges.
]

#def(name: "Directed Graph", ovcount: false)[
  A directed graph $G$ is an ordered pair $G=(V, A)$ where $V$ is the set of vertices and $A subset V times V$ called the set of arcs or directed edges.
]

#def(name: "Unweighted Graph", ovcount: false)[
  An unweighted graph $G$ is a graph is a graph where all edges are considered equal.
]

#def(name: "Weighted Graph", ovcount: false)[
  A weighted graph $G=(V, E)$ is a graph where there is a function $w: E -> RR$ where for each edge $e in E$, the weight of $e$ is $w(e)$.

#subsection("Concepts On Vertices & Edges")
#def(name: "Adjacent/Incident/Isolated", ovcount: false)[
  Let $G = (V, E)$ a graph:
  + Two vertices $u, v in V$ are adjacent or neighbors if ${u, v} in E$.
  + A vertex $v$ is called incident to an edge $e$ if $v$ is an endpoint of $e$.
  + A vertex with no incident edges is called isolated.
  + The order of $G$ is $card V$.
  + The size of $G$ is $card E$.
  + The open neighborhood of $v in V$ is $cal(N)(v) = {u in V | {u, v} in E}$.
  + The closed neighborhood of $v in V$ is $[v] = cal(N)(v) union {v}$.
  + A degree of a vertex $v$ denoted $d(v)$ or $deg(v)$ is the number of edges incident to $v$, that is $deg(v) = card N(v)$.
  + If $G$ is directed then we define the following:
    + The out neighborhood of $v in V$ is $cal(N)^+ (v) = {u in V | (v, u) in A}$.
    + The in neighborhood of $v in V$ is $cal(N)^- (v) = {u in V | (u, v) in A)$.
    + The in/out degree are $deg^- (v) = card cal(N)^- (v), deg^+ (v) = card cal(N)^+ (v)$.
  + The number of edges incident to $v$ with maximum degree of $G$, $Delta (G) = max_(v in V) d(v)$ and minimum degree is $delta (G) = min_(v in V) d(v)$.
]

#lem(name: "Handshake", ovcount: false)[
  For an undirected graph $G=(V, E)$ then $ sum_(v in V) deg(v) = 2 card E $
]

#prf[
  Every edge ${u, v} in E$ contributes exactly $1$ to $deg(u)$ and $1$ to $deg(v)$ thus adding $2$ to $sum_(v in V) deg(v)$, so all edges counted twice in the sum of all edges.
]

#thm(ovcount: false)[
  The number of vertices with odd degree is even.
]

#prf[
  Let $V_o = {v in V | d(v) "odd"}$ and $V_e = {v in V | d(v) "even"}$, by the handshake lemma we have $ 2 card E = sum_(v in V) deg(v) & = sum_(v in V_o) deg(v) + sum_(v in V_e) deg(v) $ given that $2 card E$ is even and $sum_(v in V_e) deg(V)$ is even then necessarily $sum_(v in V_o) deg(v)$ is even, and since the sum of odd numbers is even if and only if the number of odd numbers is even then $card V_o$ is even so there is an even number of odd degree vertices.

#subsection[Simple & Multigraphs]
#def(name: "Simple/Multi Graph", ovcount: false)[
  A graph $G$ is said to be simple if it has no loops and no multiple edges. A multigraph is a graph that may have loops and have multiple edges.
]

#thm(ovcount: false)[
  In any simple graph $G$ with order $n >= 2$, there exists at least two vertices with same degree.
]

#prf[
  The possible degrees in a simple graph is ${0, dots, n-1}$, however a graph cannot have a vertex with degree $0$ and $n-1$ at the same time, so either it has vertices of degree ${1, dots, n-1}$ or ${0, dots, n-2}$, and since there are $n$ vertices and $n-1$ choices for degrees, then by the pigeonhole principle, there are at least two vertices with the same degrees.
]

#pro[
  There are $binom(n, 2)$ maximum edges in a simple graph.
]

#def(name: "Walk/Trail", ovcount: false)[
  Let $G=(V, E)$ be a graph
  + A walk of length $k$ is a sequence $v_1, e_2, v_2, dots, e_k, v_k$ with $e_i = {v_(i-1), v_i} in E$.
  + A trail is a walk with no repeated edges.
  + A path is a walk with no repeated vertices.
  + A walk is closed if $v_0 = v_k$.
]

#thm(ovcount: false)[
  If there is a walk from vertex $u$ to $v$ then there is also a path from $u$ to $v$.
]

#prf[
  By induction on the length of the walk $n$. For $n = 1$, it is trivial since any $1$-walk is a path, now consider a walk of length $n$, $v_1, e_1, v_2, dots, v_(n-1), e_n, v_n$ , if $forall i, j in [|1, n|], i != j => v_i != v_j$ then it is a path, otherwise there exists $i, j$ such that $v_i = v_j$, we consider the new walk $v_1, e_1, v_2, dots, e_i, v_i, e_j, dots, e_n, v_n$, this walk has a strictly less length then the original, and thus by induction hypothesis, there is a walk from $v_1$ to $v_n$.
]

#def(name: "Circuit/Cycle", ovcount: false)[
  + A circuit is a closed trail.
  + A cycle is a closed path.
  + A cycle of length $k$ is denoted $C_k$, unless otherwise specified.
  + The length of the cycle is the number of edges in it.
  + A graph $G$ is connected if for every pair of vertices $u, v in V$ there exists a path from $u$ to $v$, otherwise it is disconnected.
  + A subgraph $H$ of $G$ is a graph such that $V(H) subset V(G)$ and $E(H) subset E(G)$.
  + A connected component of $G$ is a maximum connected subgraph of $G$.
  + A spanning subgraph $H$ of $G$ is a subgraph such that $V(H) = V(G)$.
]

#thm(ovcount: false)[
  In a connected graph, for any two longest paths in the graph, there exists a vertex they intersect in.
]

#prf[
  Suppose that there is a graph where two longest paths do not share a vertex, denote them $v_1, e_1, dots, e_(n-1), v_n$ and $v'_1, e'_1, dots, e'_(n-1), v'_n$, given that the graph is connected, then there is a path from some $v_i$ to $v'_j$ that does not intersect with the previous paths. Consider the path that goes through the furthest endpoint $v_1$ or $v_n$ from $v_i$, the path until $v_i$, then the path from $v_i$ to $v'_j$ and lastly to the furthest endpoint $v'_1$ or $v'_n$ from $v'_j$.
]

#def(ovcount: false, name: "Induced/Complement Graph")[
  + An induced subgraph $G'$ is a subset $S subset V$ and all edges from $G$ that have both endpoints in $S$.
  + A complement graph $overline(G)$ of a graph $G$ has the same vertex set $V$, and $u v in E(overline(G)) <=> u v in.not E(G)$.
]

+ $card E(G) + card E(overline(G)) = binom(n, 2)$.
+ The number of simple graphs of order $n$ is $2^binom(n, 2)$.
+ The number of spanning subgraphs of $K_n$ with $m$ edges is $binom(binom(n, 2), m)$.
+ In a graph with $n$ vertices and $m$ edges, the number of induced subgraphs of $2^n$ and the number of spanning subgraphs is $2^m$.

#section[Graph Representations]
There are several ways to represent graphs in computer memory, each with different advantages for various algorithms and applications. We represent it efficiently in memory so that it does the basic operations like edge lookup and neighborhood efficiently and minimize space complexity.

We assume throughout the course that $card V(G) = n$ vertices and $card E(G) = m$ edges, vertices are labeled from $1$ to $n$. Graphs may be directed or undirected.

#subsection[Adjacency Matrix]
Let $G=(V, E)$ be a graph with $V = {v_1, dots, v_n}$, the adjacency matrix of $G$ is an $n times n$ matrix $A = (a_(i j))$ where $ a_(i j) = cases(
  1 & "if" v_i v_j in E(G),
  0 & "otherwise"
) $

#exm[
  Here is a simple graph with its adjacency matrix
  #align(center, grid(
    columns: 2,
    column-gutter: 1cm,
    align: center + horizon,
    diagram({
      node((0cm, 0cm), $1$, stroke: 0.5pt, name: "1", radius: 0.4cm)
      node((2cm, 0cm), $2$, stroke: 0.5pt, name: "2", radius: 0.4cm)
      node((4cm, 0cm), $3$, stroke: 0.5pt, name: "3", radius: 0.4cm)
      node((2cm, -2cm), $4$, stroke: 0.5pt, name: "4", radius: 0.4cm)

      edge(label("1"), label("2"))
      edge(label("2"), label("3"))
      edge(label("2"), label("4"))
      edge(label("3"), label("4"))
    }),
    $A = mat(0, 1, 0, 0; 1, 0, 1, 1; 0, 1, 0, 1; 0, 1, 1, 0)$,
  ))
]
For weighted graphs we take the adjacency matrix would be $ a_(i j) = cases(
  w(v_i v_j) & "if" v_i v_j in E,
  "None" & "otherwise"
) $
If no edge exists, None, $infinity$ or $0$ can be assigned depending on the application.

+ Space complexity the adjacency matrix is $O(n^2)$.
+ Time to check if an edge exists is $O(1)$.
+ Time to find all neighbors of a vertex is $O(n)$.

#subsection[Adjacency List]
For a graph $G=(V, E)$ the adjacency list representation consists of an array Adj of $card V$ lists, one for each vertex in $V$. For each $u in V$, the adjacency list Adj[$u$] consists of all the vertices $v$ such that $u v in E$.

+ Space complexity $O(n + m)$.
+ Time to check if edge exists: $O(d)$ where $d$ is the degree of the vertex.
+ Time to find all neighbors of a vertex: $O(d)$.

For a weighted graph, we just add a couple $(v_j, w)$ if $v_i v_j in E$ with $w = w(v_i v_j)$.

#def(name: "Sparse/Dense Graph", ovcount: false)[
  Let $G=(V, E)$ a graph, we say that $G$ is a sparse graph if $card E << card V^2$ and we call it dense if $card E approx Theta(card V^2)$.
]

In sparse graphs the adjacency list is preferred, while in dense graphs the adjacency matrix is preferred.

#subsection[Incidence Matrix]
Given a graph $G=(V, E)$, the incidence matrix $M$ is defined as follows $ M_(i j) = cases(
  1 & "if" v_i "is incident to" e_j,
  0 & "otherwise"
) $
#align(center, grid(
  columns: 2,
  column-gutter: 1cm,
  align: center + horizon,
  diagram({
    node((0cm, 0cm), $1$, stroke: 0.5pt, name: "1", radius: 0.4cm)
    node((2cm, 0cm), $2$, stroke: 0.5pt, name: "2", radius: 0.4cm)
    node((4cm, 0cm), $3$, stroke: 0.5pt, name: "3", radius: 0.4cm)
    node((2cm, -2cm), $4$, stroke: 0.5pt, name: "4", radius: 0.4cm)

    edge(label("1"), label("2"), $e_1$)
    edge(label("2"), label("3"), $e_2$)
    edge(label("3"), label("4"), $e_3$, bend: 30deg)
    edge(label("2"), label("4"), $e_4$)
    edge(label("1"), label("4"), $e_5$, bend: -30deg)
  }),
  $M = mat(1, 0, 0, 0, 1; 1, 1, 0, 1, 0; 0, 1, 1, 0, 0; 0, 0, 1, 1, 1)$,
))

For a directed graph, we define the following representation $ M_(i j) = cases(
  +1 & "if" e_j "enters the vertex" v_i,
  -1 & "if" e_j "leaves the vertex" v_i,
  0 & "otherwise"
) $

#section[Graph Traversal Algorithms]
Graph traversal algorithms systematically explores the vertices of the graph. They are fundamental building blocks for many other graph algorithms.

#subsection[Breadth-First Search]
Fundamental graph traversal algorithm explores a graph layer by layer, starting from a source vertex, it visits all its directed neighbors (vertices at distance 1) before moving on to the neighbors of those neighbors, (vertices at distance 2) and so on. BFS uses a Queue data structure (First-In First-Out) to manage the order of exploration. The goal of BFS is to discover all vertices reachable from source $s$ and compute the shortest path distance $s$ to each reachable vertex.

```pcode
procedure BFS(G, s):
  - Create a queue Q.
  - Create a set visited.
  - Create a map distance with values infinity.

  visited.add(s)
  distance[s] = 0
  Q.enqueue(s)

  while Q not empty do
    v = Q.dequeue()
    - Process vertex v.

    for each neighbor w of v
      if w is not visited then
        visited.add(w)
        distance[w] = distance[v] + 1
        Q.enqueue(w)
      end
    end
  end

  return distance
```

Global complexity with adjacency list is $O(n+m)$, and space complexity is $O(n)$.

#prf[
  If $u$ is reachable from $s$, then there exists a shortest path from $s$ to $u$ of length $delta(s, u)$, appending the edge $(u, v)$ gives a path from $s$ to $v$ of length $delta(s, u) + 1$. Since $delta(s, v)$ is defined as the minimum length then necessarily $delta(s, v) <= delta(s, u) + 1$. If $u$ is not reachable from $s$, then trivially $delta(s, u) + 1 = infinity$
]

#lem(ovcount: false)[
  Suppose that during the execution of BFS on a graph $G=(V, E)$, the queue $Q$ contains the vertices $[v_1, dots, v_r]$ where $v_1$ is the head of $Q$ and $v_r$ is the tail of $Q$. Then the following holds:
  + $d(v_r) <= d(v_1) + 1$.
  + $forall i in [|1, dots, r-1|], d(v_i) <= d(v_(i+1))$.

#prf[
  By induction on the number of queue operations.
  - Base case: initially, the queue contains the source vertex $s$, the lemma is trivial.
  - Assume the lemma holds before queue operations, we must show that it continues to hold after a dequeue.
    - Dequeue operation: if the head $v_1$ is dequeued then $v_2$ becomes the new head (unless the queue becomes empty, in which case the statement remains true), by induction hypothesis we have that $d(v_1) <= d(v_2)$ since $d(v_r) <= d(v_1) + 1$ we obtain that $d(v_r) <= d(v_2) + 1$ and all the other inequalities remain.
    - Enqueue operation: suppose a vertex $v$ is discovered while scanning the adjacency list of some vertex, hence $d(v) = d(u) + 1$ and enqueue $v$ at the tail of the queue. At the moment, $u$ has already been dequeued. By the induction hypothesis the current head $v_1$ satisfies $d(u) <= d(v_1)$. Therefore, $d(v) = d(u) + 1 <= d(v_1) + 1$. Furthermore, the previous tail $d(v_r) <= d(u) + 1 = d(v)$. Therefore, the lemma holds for all queue operations.
  Which proves this lemma.

#prf[
  Using induction on the shortest path $delta(s, v) = k$, because for $k = 0$ the only vertex $v$ such that $delta(s, v) = 0$ is $s$ itself. BFS initialize $d[s] = 0$ thus $d[s] = delta(s, s) = 0$. By induction, assume that forall vertices $u$ with $delta(s, u) = k$, BFS assign correctly $d[u] = k$, consider a vertex $v$ such that $delta(s, v) = k + 1$. By definition of shortest distance there exists a vertex $u$ such that $(u, v) in E$ and $delta(s, u) = k$. By inductive step $d[u]=k$. When $u$ is dequeued, the algorithm examines all neighbors of $v$ is undiscovered. BFS sets $d[v] = d[u] + 1$. Since BFS explores vertices in non-decreasing order of distance, $v$ cannot have been discovered at a distance smaller than $k + 1$ (otherwise a shortest path to $v$ would be contradicting $delta(s, v) = k + 1$. Thus, the first time $v$ is reached, it is assigned $d[v] = k + 1$.

  d[s] = 0

        Q.enqueue(w)
      end
    end
  end

  x = argmax(d)
  return (x, d[x])
```

Now that we have the modified BFS, we can use it to search the diameter of the tree, that is, we start with a random vertex, go to the furthest vertex, and from that vertex, we apply the same thing again, which will give us the longest path.

```pcode
procedure TREEdiameter(T)
  - chose an arbitrary vertex s in V
  (u, _) = BFSmodified(T, s)
  (v, d) = BFSmodified(T, u)
  return d
```
The complexity of the pseudocode $O(n)$.

The BFS builds a BFS-Tree as it searches the graph. The tree corresponds to the $p$ attributes. For a graph $G=(V, E)$ with sources. Let $G_p = (V_p, E_p)$ where $V_p = {v in V | p(v) != "Nil"} union {s}$ and $E_p = {(p(v),v) | v in V_p \\ {s}}$. The predecessor subgraph $G_q$ is a BFS tree if $V_p$ consists of the vertices reachable from $s$ and for all $v in V_p$, the subgraph $G_p$ contains a unique simple path from $s$ to $v$, that is the shortest path from $s$ to $v$ in $G$. A BFS-Tree is in fact a tree, since it is connected by construction and $|E_p| = |V_p| - 1$.

#subsection[Depth-First Search]
DFS is a graph traversal algorithm that explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. DFS uses stack data structure (LIFO) to manage the exploration path.

There are two ways to implement DFS, either recursive or iterative.

- *Recursive*
  ```pcode
  procedure DFSvisit(G, v, visited):
    visited.add(v)

    for each neighbor w of v do
      if w not visited then
        P[w] = v
        DFSvisit(G, w, visited)
      end
    end

  procedure DFS(G):
    - create a set visited
    - create a parent array P

    for each v in G do
      if v not visited then
        DFSvisit(G, v, visited)
      end
    end
  ```

- *Iterative*
  ```pcode
  procedure DFS(G, s):
    - create a stack S
    - create a set visited
    - create a parent array P

    while S not empty do
      v = S.pop()
      if v not visited then
        visited.add(v)
        - Process vertex v
        for neighborhood w of v in reverse order do
          if w not visited then
            P[w] = v
            S.push(w)
          end
        end
      end
    end
  ```

*Discovering And Finishing Time:*
#def(name: "Discovering/Finishing Time", ovcount: false)[
  We define the following functions:
  - $d[U]$: the time when $U$ was visited first.
  - $f[U]$: the time when the exploration of $U$ adjacency list is completed.
]

It is clear that $d[U] < f[U]$ for any vertex $U$.

#def(name: "Edge Classification", ovcount: false)[
  Let $(u, v)$ be an edge of a direct graph explored during DFS, then we define the following classes:
  - Tree edge: if $v$ is first discovered when exploring $u$, $P[v] = u$.
  - Back edge: if $v$ is an ancestor of $u$.
  - Forward edge: if $v$ is a descendent of $u$, $d[u] < d[v]$.
  - Cross edge: $d[u] > d[v]$ and $u, v$ are in different branches.
]

*Pranthesis Structure:* A fundamental property of DFS is that discovery and finishing times of vertices follow a parenthesis structure, more precisely, if we denote the discovering of a vertex by $(u$ and its finishing time by $u)$ then the sequence of events produced by a DFS forms a properly parenthesized expression.

#prf[
  Without loss of generality, assume $d[u] < d[v]$, since all timestamps are distinct (the clock increments before each assignment, so all $2|V|$ timestamps are distinct). There are two subcases according to wether $d[v] < f[u]$ or not.
  - Case 1: $d[v] < f[u]$, so $v$ is discovered while $u$ is still open (not finished), which implies that $v$ is a descendent of $u$. Moreover, since $v$ is discovered after $u$ it is finished before $u$, hence $[d[v], f[v]] subset [d[u], f[u]]$.
  - Case 2: $d[v] > f[u]$ then $d[u] < f[u] < d[v] < f[v]$, thus the intervals are entirely disjoint no vertex is a descendent of another, it is obtained by the symmetry $d[v] < d[u]$.

  In many real world scenarios, we're interested not just in whether a path exists between points, but finding the most efficient or optimal path. For example, the shortest path problem: given a weighted graph, find a path between two vertices such that the sum of the weights of its edges is minimized.
]

#section[Djikstra's Algorithm]
Djikstra's algorithm solves the single source shortest path problem. The algorithm works for weighted graphs with non-negative weighted edges.

```pcode
procedure Djikstra(G, s):
  - initialize distance d[v] = ∞ for all vertices v
  - initialize d[s] = 0.
  - create a parent array P
  - create a distance priority queue with all vertices

  while Q not empty do
    - extract vertex u with minimum distance from Q
    for each neighbor v of u do
      alt = d[u] + weight(u, v)
      if alt < d[v] then
        d[v] = alt
        P[v] = u
        - update priority v in Q
      end
    end
  end
```

The complexity of the Djikstra algorithm is dependent on the implementation of the extract min function
- if it is array-based with normal search, the extraction is $O(n)$ and thus the total complexity is $O(n^2 + m) tilde.eq O(n^2)$.
- if it is implemented as binary heap, then extramin will be in $O(log(n))$ and decreasing key is $O(log(n))$ and thus the total complexity is $O((n+m)log(n))$.

#thm(name: "Djikstra's Algorithm Correctness", ovcount: false)[
  Djikstra's algorithm gives the shortest algorithm on a postive weighted graph.
]

#prf[
  We proceed by induction on $S$.
  - $S = emptyset$, the first extracted vertex is $S$, $d[s] = 0 = delta(s, s)$, holds.
  - Assume for all vertices $x in S$ we have $d[x] = delta(s, x)$. Let $v in S$ be the next vertex extracted from the priority queue. By definition $d[v] = min_(x in.not S) d[x]$, assume by contradiction that $d[v] > delta(s, v)$, consider a shortest path from $s$ to $v$ and $(x, y))$ be the first edge on this path such that $x in S$, $y in.not S$, by inductive hypothesis $d[x] = delta(s, x)$, when $x$ is processed, the relaxation step ensures that $d[y] <= d[x] + w(x, y) = delta(s, x) + w(x, y) = delta(s, y)$. Since all weights are non-negative, the remaining path from $y$ to $v$ cannot decrease the distance so $delta(s, y) <= delta(s, v)$ thus $d[y] <= delta(s, v)$. But since $v$ is chosen to be the minimum then $d[x] <= d[y]$ since $y in.not S$, thus $d[v] <= d[y] <= delta(s, y) <= delta(s, v)$ which contradicts the assumption of $d[v] > delta(s, v)$.

#section[Bellman-Ford Algorithm]
Which Djikstra's algorithm works efficiently for graphs with non-negative weights if fails when negative weights are present. The Bellman-Ford algorithm solves this single source.

```pcode
procedure BellmanFord(G, s):
  - initilize distances d[v] to infinity
  for v vertex in G do
    d[s] = 0
  end

  for i = 1 to #V - 1 do
    for each edge vu with weight w in G do
      if d[v] + w < d[v] do
        d[v] = d[u] + w
        p[v] = u
      end
    end
  end

  for each edge uv with weight w in G do
    if d[u] + w < d[v] then
      return "negative cycle"
    end
  end

  return d[], p[]
```

#exr(ovcount: false)[
  Prove the correctness of Bellman-Ford algorithm (assuming that there are no negative cycles).
]

Let $p$ be the shortest path from $s$ to $v$
- base case $d[s] = 0 = delta(s, s)$.
- Assume that all shortest path of length $k$ are determined in iteration $1$, all shortest path of length $1$ are determined, same for the next iteration, then continuing each iteration, we have that $d[v] <= d[v_k] + w(v_k, v)$. Hence all shortest path of length $<= k+1$ edges are correctly identified.

#section[Floyd-Wrashall Algorithm]
Sometimes we need to find shortest paths between all pairs of vertices while we could run Djikstra's algorithm $card V$ times, the Floyd-Warshall algorithm offers an elegant solution.

```pcode
procedure FloydWarshall(G):
  - Create distance matrix
  - d[i, j] = w(i, j), d[i, i] = 0
  for k = 1 to #V do
    for j = 1 to #V do
      for i = 1 to #V do
        if d[i, k] + d[k, j] < d[i, j] then
          d[i, j] = d[i, k] + d[k, j]
        end
      end
    end
  end

  return d
```

#section[Maximum Flow & Min Cuts]
Many engineering and optimization problems can be modeled as movement of a material through a network of conducts from a source to a sink. The fundamental algorithmic question is what is the maximum rate at which material can be shipped from source to sink, respecting the capacity of each conduct.

#def(name: "Flow Network", ovcount: false)[
  A flow network is a directed graph $G=(V, E)$ together with a capacity function $C: V times V -> RR$ satisfying:
  + $forall u v in E, C(u, v) >= 0$.
  + $forall u v in.not E, C(u, v) = 0$
  + No self loops, no anti-parallel pairs.
  + Two distinguied vertices a source $s$ and sink $t$.
  + Every vertex $v in V$ lies on a source path $s -> v -> t$.
]

#def(name: "Flow", ovcount: false)[
  Let $G = (V, E)$ be a directed graph and $C: V times V -> RR$ a capacity function. A flow in $G$ is a function $f: V times V -> RR$ satisfying the two following properties
  - Capacity constraint: $forall u, v in V, 0 <= f(u, v) <= C(u, v)$.
  - Flow conservation: $forall u in V \\ {s, t}, sum_(v in V) f(u, v) = sum_(v in V) f(v, u)$
  The value of a flow is $|f| = sum_(v in V) f(s, v) - sum_(v in V) f(v, s)$.
]

What if the problem has several sources ${s_1, dots, s_n}$ and several sinks ${t_1, dots, t_n}$? Given a flow $f$ in $G$, the residual network $G_f = (V, E_f)$ captures how additional flow can be pushed away each edge in either directions.

#def(name: "Residual Capacity/Residual Network", ovcount: false)[
  Let $G = (V, E)$ be a flow network, for vertices $u, v in V$ the residual capacities are defined as $ C_f (u, v) = cases(
    C(u, v) - f(u, v) & "if" u v in E_f "(Forward residual edge)",
    f(v, u) & "if" v u in E_f "(Backward residual edge)",
    0 & "otherwise"
  ) $
  The residual network is $G_f = (V, E_f)$ where $ E_f = {(u, v) in V times V | C_f (u, v) > 0} $
]

#def(name: "Augmenting Path", ovcount: false)[
  Let $G$ be a flow network, an augmenting path $p$ is a simple path from $s$ to $t$ in the residual network $G_f$, the residual capacity of $p$ is $C_f (p) = min_((u, v) in p) C_f (u, v)$.
]

#def(name: "Cut", ovcount: false)[
  A cut $(s, t)$ of a flow network $G=(V, E)$ is a partition of $V$ into $S$ and $T = V\\S$ such that $s in S$ and $t in T$. 
  - Net flow across the cut: $f(S, T) = limits(sum)_((u, v) in S times T) f(u, v) - limits(sum)_((u, v) in S times T) f(v, u)$.

  - Capacity of the cut: $C(S, T) = limits(sum)_((u, v) in S times T) C(u, v)$
]

#def(name: "Minimum Cut", ovcount: false)[
  A minimum cut is a cut of minimum capacity over all cuts of $G$.
]

#lem(ovcount: false)[
  Let $f$ be a flow in $G$ and $(s, t)$ any cut, then $f(S, T) = |f|$.
]

#prf[
  By flow conservation, for every internal vertex $u in S\\{s}$: $sum_(v in V) f(u, v) - sum_(v in V) f(v, u) = 0$. $
    |f| &= sum_(v in V) f(s, v) - sum_(v in V) f(v, s)\
    |f| &= sum_(u in S) sum_(v in V) f(u, v) - sum_(u in S) sum_(v in V) f(v, u)
  $ setting the sum over $V$ into $S$ and $T$: $
    |f| &= sum_(u in S) sum_(v in T) f(u, v) - sum_(u in S) sum_(v in T) f(v, u) = sum_(u in S) sum_(v in V) f(u, v) - sum_(u in S) sum_(v in S) f(v, u)
  $
]

#cor(ovcount: false)[
  For any flow $f$ and any cut $(S, T)$, $|f| <= C(S, T)$.
]

#prf[
  $
    |f| = f(S, T) &= sum_(u in S) sum_(v in T) f(u, v) - sum_(u in S) sum_(v in T) f(v, u)\
    &<= sum_(u in S) sum_(v in T) f(u, v)\
    &<= sum_(u in S) sum_(v in V) C(u, v) = C(S, T)
  $
]

#thm(ovcount: false)[
  Let $f$ be a flow in $G$, the following statements are equivalent:
  + $f$ is a maximum flow in $G$.
  + The residual network $G_f$ contains no augmenting path from $s$ to $t$.
  + $|f| = C(S, T)$ for some cut $(S, T)$ of $G$.
]

#prf[Exercise]

#subsection[Ford-Fulkerson Method]
The Ford-Fulkerson method is a framework that repeatdly finds any augmenting path in $G_f$ and augment the flow along it until no augmenting path exists. By the max flow min cut theorem, the resulting flow is maximum.


```pcode
procedure FordFulkerson(G, s, t):
  - Initialize flow f(u, v) = 0 for all edges uv in E.
  - Construct the residual graph Gf

  while there exists a path P from s to t in Gf do
    Cf(P) = min{Cf(u, v) | uv in P}
    for each edge uv in P do
      if uv is a forward edge
        then f(u, v) = f(u, v) + Cf(P)
        else f(v, u) = f(v, u) - Cf(P)
    end
  end

  return flow f
```

If BFS is always used for augmenting path, we get Edmonds-Karp algorithm with complexity $O(card E |f|)$.

#subsection[Minimum Cost, Maximum Flow]
The maximum flow problem asks for the largest possible flow from source $s$ to sink $t$, in many practical settings, sending flow along different arcs include different costs, pipeline tarifs, energy consumption, transportation fees, and the cheapest maximum flow is the desired objective.

#def(name: "Min Cost - Max Flow", ovcount: false)[
  Given a directed graph $G = (V, E)$, a source $s$ and a sink $t$, a capacity function $C: E -> NN$ and a cost function $w: E -> RR$. The minimum cost maximum flow problem asks for a flow $f^*: E -> RR$ such that:
  - Capacity: $forall u v in E, 0 <= f^* (u, v) <= C(u, v)$.
  - Conservation: $forall u in V\\{s, t}, sum f^* (u, v) = sum f^* (v, u)$.
  - Maximum value: $|f^*|$ is maximum.
  - Minimum costs: $"cost"(f^*) = sum_(u v in E) w(u, v) f^*  (u, v)$.
]

#def(name: "Cost Of Augmenting Path", ovcount: false)[
  The cost of an $s - t$ path $P$ in $G_f$ is $w(P) = sum_(u v in P) tilde(w) (u, v)$ where $
    tilde(w) (u, v) = cases(
      w(u, v) &"if" u v "is a forward edge",
      -w(u, v) &"if" u v "is a backward edge"
    )
  $
]

The successive shortest paths algorithm:
- Input: Network $(G, C, w)$, source $s$ and sink $t$.
- Output: A minimum cost, maximum flow $f^*$.

+ Initilize the flow $f(u, v)$ for all $u v in E$ and construct the residual graph $G_f$.
+ While there exists an $s, t$ path in $G_f$ do
  + Find a shortest (minimum cost) path in $G_f$ using Bellman-Ford.
  + Compute the bottleneck capacity $delta = min_(u v in P) C_f (u, v)$.
  + Augment $f(u, v) = delta$ on forward edges, $f(u, v) = - delta$ on backward edges.
+ Return $f$.
It has complexity $O(card V card E |f^*|)$.
